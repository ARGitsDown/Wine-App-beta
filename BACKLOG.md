# Hygiene Backlog

Known data-model gaps and inconsistencies worth revisiting as the app
matures. These aren't new features — they're refinements to data we
already collect, where the current model is a working simplification
rather than a wrong one. Add to this list as new gaps surface; check items
off (or delete them) once addressed.

## ~~1. Standardized/canonical varietal name~~ — done

`variety`/`type` still store whatever name is printed or regionally
conventional, but filtering now also resolves a search term to a
canonical grape (via `lib/varietals.js`'s ~140-entry reference list and
`lib/varietal-match.js`) and matches any bottle logged under a synonym -
so "show me all my Grenache" also finds a bottle logged as Garnacha or
Cannonau, without changing what's actually printed in `variety`. Covers
all the synonym clusters originally called out here (Grenache/Garnacha/
Cannonau, Mourvèdre/Mataro/Monastrell, Pinot Noir/Pinot Nero/
Spätburgunder, Syrah/Shiraz, Zinfandel/Primitivo, Sauvignon Blanc/Fumé
Blanc) plus many more. A blend or an unrecognized/obscure grape
deliberately falls back to plain substring matching rather than a guess.

## ~~2. Regional hierarchy depth~~ — lightweight version done

Added one more flat, optional field - `subRegion` - alongside `region`
(e.g. "Margaux" under region "Bordeaux"), rather than the full Country/
Region/Sub-Region/Appellation depth CellarTracker tracks. Both scanning
and manual entry fill it in, and it's filterable like every other field.
A genuine multi-level hierarchy (Bordeaux → Médoc → Margaux, each with
its own identity rather than a string) is still open if `subRegion` alone
proves insufficient, but that's a bigger schema question than this was.

## ~~3. Wine color/category, distinct from `type`~~ — done

`wineColor` is a new field with a fixed vocabulary (Red/White/Rosé/
Orange/Sparkling/Dessert/Fortified - see `lib/wine-colors.js`), separate
from `type`/`variety`. The scan feature infers it from the label/photo;
manual entry is a plain dropdown rather than an auto-guess, since the
same grape can make wines of different colors (a Pinot Noir rosé, for
instance) and a text-only guess could confidently mislabel one. "Show me
all my whites" now works via the Color filter on Inventory/Wishlist/
History.

## ~~4. Drinking window~~ — done

`drinkFrom`/`drinkTo` (year, both independently optional) are now
captured - filled in by the scan feature when the label/sheet states one
or there's a genuinely confident basis to estimate it, otherwise left
null rather than guessed. The Suggest feature's `browse_cellar` tool now
returns each candidate's window and is told the current year, and is
steered toward a bottle that's actually ready over one that's too young
or past peak (falling back honestly rather than silently ignoring the
window when nothing ready fits). Shown on the bottle detail page as a
"ready / too young / past peak" badge.

## 5. Bottle size / format

`quantity` counts bottles but doesn't distinguish sizes (375ml half,
750ml standard, 1.5L magnum, etc.) — two half-bottles and two magnums
both just read "quantity: 2" today, which understates or overstates how
much wine you actually have.

## ~~6. Alcohol % (ABV)~~ — done

`abv` (a float, e.g. 14.5) is now captured - filled in by the scan
feature when printed on the label (nearly always), and editable manually
otherwise.

## Lower priority / optional

- **Price tracking** — what you paid, or current market value. Useful for
  cellar valuation, but a bigger feature than a hygiene fix. The
  tasting-sheet scan already sees "Regular $X / Sale $Y" pricing and
  currently just folds it into free-text notes.
- **Critic scores** — a wine's Wine Spectator/Parker/etc. score, distinct
  from your own personal rating. Nice-to-have, not urgent for a personal
  cellar app.
